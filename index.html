                Since the 1970s skateboarding has developed its own culture, music (skate punk) and even entertainment channels such as the xgames which for many years was seen as the extreme sport version of the olympics. although be thought of as a nucence in city centeres and even being associated with criminal activity such as vandalism which also sparked the "skatebosrding is not a crime" movement, skateboarding continued to grow in popularity through out the 90's and been pushed to the forefront of popular culture, being fetured in songs such as opm- heaven is a halfpipe, even producing films such as street dreams.
