               <h1>The Ollie</h1>
           </div>

           <div class = "text">
               <P>The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the rider's hands. A combination of stomping (also known as "popping") the tail of the skateboard off the ground to get the board mostly vertical, jumping, and sliding the front foot forward to level out the skateboard at the peak of the jump.
               The ollie is a fundamental skill in skateboarding. Ollies are necessary to leap onto, over, or off obstacles. As most flip tricks depend on it, the ollie is often the first skill to be learned by a new skateboarder, therefore it typically takes considerable practice to learn.</P>

            <h1>The kickflip</h1>
        </div>

        <div class = "text">
            <P>The kickflip is a trick in skateboarding in which the rider flips their skateboard 360Â° along the axis that extends from the nose to the tail of the deck.
            It was the first of many modern flip tricks to be invented or modified by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s. The original kickflip was invented by pioneer Curt Lindgren prior to 1978 and was later modified and popularized by Rodney Mullen. As of March 2011, the popular trick has expanded into other sports such as surfing where the first kickflip in surfing was landed by Zoltan "The Magician" Torkos.</P>

            <h1>The Manual </h1>
        </div>

        <div class = "text">
            <P> A Manual is a trick similar to a bicycle wheelie where the skateboarder balances with only the front or the back wheels touching the ground. Manuals can be done with either or both wheels or on a single wheel. A Manual in which both feet are straight on the nose is called a Hang Ten. English Manuals place the back foot at the back bolts and the front foot underneath the nose.</P>
